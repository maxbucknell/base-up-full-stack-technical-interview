Thanks for completing the exercises! Please feel free to explain your own code in this Pull Request, as well as anything else you noticed about this code, that isnâ€™t covered by the below questions:

### How is `numberOfHours` calculated?

### Can `calculateDayPrice` return a negative value? How? What should happen in these circumstances?

### How well does this code generalise? Do you think it would be possible to add a weekly pricing tier?
